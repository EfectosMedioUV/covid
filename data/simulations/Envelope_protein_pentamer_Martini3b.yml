title: Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein E in the pentameric form
description: > 
    1. The trajectories of coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 
       unmodified, palmitoylated SARS-CoV-2 E protein pentamer in a POPC bilayer. 
    2. The trajectory of CG MD of system containing 2 pentamers in the curved membrane.
